# Technical Architecture

This document provides an in-depth look at the technical design and architecture of DeCharge Evolution.

## System Overview

DeCharge Evolution is a Solana-based decentralized application that bridges real-world EV charging with on-chain rewards. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns:

- **Smart Contracts Layer** - On-chain programs managing state and business logic
- **Service Layer** - Off-chain services for real-time data and orchestration  
- **Presentation Layer** - Web dashboard with live updates and 3D visualization
- **Shared Layer** - Common types, utilities, and SDK for cross-layer communication

## Component Architecture

### 1. Smart Contracts (Anchor Programs)

The Solana program manages all on-chain state using Anchor framework.

**Program Structure:**

- `ChargingNetwork` - Unified program handling all instructions
- Uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for deterministic account discovery
- Implements oracle pattern for verified off-chain data
- Emits events for indexing and real-time updates

**Account Model:**

The program uses several account types, each with specific seeds for PDA derivation:

| Account | Seeds | Purpose | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PlatformConfig` | `["config"]` | Global configuration: admin, oracle, treasuries, point rate | 177 bytes |
| `ChargingStation` | `["station", station_id]` | Station metadata: location, capacity, pricing | 340 bytes |
| `DriverProfile` | `["driver", driver_pubkey]` | Driver statistics: sessions, energy, points | 73 bytes |
| `ChargingSession` | `["session", station, counter]` | Session telemetry: energy, time, points, status | 201 bytes |
| `PointsVault` | `["vault", driver_pubkey]` | SPL token escrow for driver-earned points | 73 bytes |
| `WorldPlot` | `["plot", region_key]` | Virtual plot ownership and charger metadata | 118 bytes |

**Account Relationships:**

```
PlatformConfig (singleton)
    ├── oracle: Pubkey (authorized to submit telemetry)
    ├── point_mint: Pubkey (SPL token for rewards)
    └── treasuries: Pubkeys (payment destinations)

ChargingStation (many per network)
    ├── operator: Pubkey (station owner)
    └── referenced by ChargingSession

DriverProfile (one per driver)
    ├── driver: Pubkey (wallet address)
    ├── cumulative stats (sessions, energy, points)
    └── referenced by PointsVault

ChargingSession (many per station)
    ├── station: Pubkey (which station)
    ├── driver: Pubkey (who is charging)
    ├── telemetry: energy_wh, seconds_elapsed
    ├── status: Active | Closed
    └── timestamps: opened_at, closed_at

PointsVault (one per driver)
    ├── driver: Pubkey
    ├── token_account: Pubkey (SPL token account)
    └── holds earned points until purchase

WorldPlot (many per virtual world)
    ├── owner: Pubkey (plot owner)
    ├── region_key: [u8; 64] (unique identifier)
    ├── upgrade_level: u8 (1-3)
    └── slot_capacity: u32 (concurrent sessions)
```

**Instruction Flow:**

The program exposes these instructions:

1. `initialize_platform` - One-time setup (admin, oracle, treasuries)
2. `register_station` - Add charging station to network
3. `start_session` - Begin tracking a charging session
4. `record_telemetry` - Update session with energy/time data
5. `close_session` - Finalize session and mint points
6. `purchase_points` - Transfer points from driver to buyer
7. `claim_world_plot` - Register virtual plot ownership

### 2. Gateway Service

The gateway is a Fastify-based Node.js server that bridges the simulator and web application.

**Responsibilities:**

- Accept telemetry events via POST /ingest
- Maintain in-memory state (stations, sessions, marketplace, world)
- Broadcast updates via WebSocket to connected clients
- Provide REST APIs for initial data load
- Validate all incoming events with Zod schemas

**Key Endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| WS | `/stream` | WebSocket for real-time events |
| GET | `/api/dashboard` | Aggregated network metrics |
| GET | `/api/stations` | List all charging stations |
| GET | `/api/sessions` | Recent charging sessions |
| GET | `/api/marketplace` | Available point packages |
| GET | `/api/world` | Claimed virtual plots |
| GET | `/api/events` | Recent activity feed |
| POST | `/ingest` | Submit events from simulator |

**State Management:**

```typescript
interface GatewayState {
  stations: Map<string, GatewayStation>;
  sessions: Map<string, GatewaySession>;
  marketplace: GatewayMarketplaceItem[];
  world: Map<string, GatewayWorldPlot>;
  recentEvents: GatewayLiveEvent[]; // circular buffer (max 200)
}
```

**Event Broadcasting:**

When an event is ingested:
1. Validate payload with Zod schema
2. Update in-memory state
3. Broadcast to all WebSocket clients
4. Add to recent events buffer
5. Return success response

This architecture provides sub-100ms latency for real-time updates.

### 3. Charging Simulator

The simulator generates realistic charging activity for demonstration purposes.

**Simulation Logic:**

- **Stations:** 5 pre-configured stations with different capacities (80-140 kW)
- **Drivers:** 6 personas with various vehicle models
- **Sessions:** Lifecycle includes start, multiple updates, completion
- **Marketplace:** Random point purchases (40-60% trigger rate)
- **Virtual World:** Plot claims and virtual sessions

**Event Generation:**

```typescript
// Session start (every 14 seconds)
{
  type: "session_start",
  stationId: "stat-bravo",
  driver: "Noah Singh",
  vehicleModel: "Tesla Model 3 Highland",
  energyDeliveredKwh: 2.3,
  pointsEarned: 230
}

// Session update (every 6 seconds per active session)
{
  type: "session_update",
  sessionId: "abc123",
  energyDeliveredKwh: 5.7, // cumulative
  pointsEarned: 570,
  status: "charging"
}

// Session complete (25% chance per update)
{
  type: "session_complete",
  sessionId: "abc123",
  energyDeliveredKwh: 12.8,
  pointsEarned: 1280
}
```

**Timing Configuration:**

| Event Type | Interval | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Session start | 14 seconds | New charging sessions |
| Session update | 6 seconds | Energy/point increments |
| Station status | 18 seconds | Health checks |
| Marketplace purchase | 22 seconds | Point redemptions |
| Plot claim | 28 seconds | Virtual plot ownership |
| Virtual session | 12 seconds | Virtual charging activity |

### 4. Web Application

The Next.js application provides the user interface with real-time updates and 3D visualization.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with custom design system
- **3D Graphics:** Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **State Management:** Zustand for global state
- **Real-time:** Native WebSocket API with SWR
- **Blockchain:** @solana/web3.js and wallet adapter

**Page Structure:**

The main dashboard (`app/page.tsx`) is organized into sections:

```tsx
<Layout>
  <Header /> // Title and description
  
  <MetricCards> // Energy, utilization, points
    <MetricCard title="Energy delivered" />
    <MetricCard title="Network utilization" />
    <MetricCard title="Points minted" />
  </MetricCards>
  
  <TwoColumnGrid>
    <LeftColumn>
      <LiveSessionTable /> // Active sessions
    </LeftColumn>
    <RightColumn>
      <ActivityFeed /> // Recent events
    </RightColumn>
  </TwoColumnGrid>
  
  <TwoColumnGrid>
    <MarketplaceGrid /> // Point packages
    <WorldSceneWrapper> // 3D virtual world
      <ThreeJsCanvas />
    </WorldSceneWrapper>
  </TwoColumnGrid>
</Layout>
```

**Real-Time Data Flow:**

```typescript
// Custom hook for WebSocket connection
const useGatewayData = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState<GatewayState>();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8787/stream');
    
    ws.onopen = () => {
      console.log('Connected to gateway');
    };
    
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
      
      if (message.type === 'bootstrap') {
        // Initial state load
        setData(message.payload);
      } else {
        // Incremental update
        updateState(message);
      }
    };
    
    return () => ws.close();
  }, []);
  
  return data;
};
```

**3D World Rendering:**

The virtual world uses React Three Fiber for declarative 3D:

```tsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 50, 100] }}>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.4} />
  <directionalLight position={[10, 20, 5]} />
  
  {plots.map(plot => (
    <InteractivePlot
      key={plot.regionKey}
      position={plot.coordinates}
      color={getColorForVibe(plot.vibe)}
      onClick={() => selectPlot(plot)}
    />
  ))}
  
  <OrbitControls />
  <Fog attach="fog" args={['#101010', 50, 200]} />
</Canvas>
```

## Data Flow Patterns

### Session Lifecycle

Complete flow from charging start to point redemption:

```
1. Simulator generates session_start
   ↓
2. POST /ingest to gateway
   ↓
3. Gateway validates and stores session
   ↓
4. Gateway broadcasts via WebSocket
   ↓
5. Web app receives and renders in table
   ↓
6. Simulator sends periodic updates
   ↓
7. Web app shows energy/points increasing
   ↓
8. Simulator sends session_complete
   ↓
9. Web app marks session as completed
   ↓
10. Points available in marketplace
   ↓
11. User purchases points via Solana Pay
   ↓
12. Gateway updates inventory and broadcasts
   ↓
13. Web app shows transaction success
```

### Virtual World Interaction

User claiming a plot:

```
1. User explores 3D scene
   ↓
2. Clicks on unclaimed plot
   ↓
3. Plot details panel shows information
   ↓
4. User clicks "Claim Plot"
   ↓
5. Frontend calls claim_world_plot instruction
   ↓
6. User signs transaction in wallet
   ↓
7. Transaction executes on Solana
   ↓
8. Simulator detects new plot (would be on-chain event)
   ↓
9. Simulator sends world_plot_claim to gateway
   ↓
10. Gateway broadcasts to all clients
   ↓
11. 3D scene updates to show ownership
   ↓
12. Future virtual sessions route to this plot
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture (Demo)

- **Gateway:** Single in-memory instance, max ~1000 concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Simulator:** Generates ~50 events per minute, easily handled by gateway
- **Web App:** Client-side rendering, scales horizontally with CDN
- **Blockchain:** Solana supports 65,000 TPS, no bottleneck for our use case

### Production Scaling

**Gateway Service:**
- Replace in-memory state with Redis for persistence
- Add Redis Pub/Sub for multi-instance coordination
- Use load balancer for horizontal scaling
- Implement connection pooling for WebSockets

**Event Processing:**
- Add message queue (RabbitMQ, Kafka) between simulator and gateway
- Implement backpressure mechanisms
- Batch similar events for efficiency
- Use worker processes for heavy computation

**Database Layer:**
- Add PostgreSQL for historical data
- Index sessions by driver, station, timestamp
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Cache frequently accessed data in Redis

**Blockchain Integration:**
- Use Helius/Triton webhooks for on-chain events
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor RPC rate limits and rotate endpoints
- Cache program account data with TTL

## Security Model

### Smart Contract Security

**Access Control:**
- `PlatformConfig.admin` can update configuration
- `PlatformConfig.oracle` can submit telemetry
- Only driver can claim their points
- Only plot owner can upgrade their charger

**Input Validation:**
- All numeric inputs checked for overflow
- String inputs bounded by constants (MAX_NAME_LEN, etc.)
- Timestamps validated against block time
- Signatures verified for oracle attestations

**Economic Safety:**
- Point rate uses microunits to prevent rounding errors
- Session state prevents double-claiming points
- Marketplace checks inventory before transfers
- Treasury addresses validated on initialization

### Off-Chain Security

**Gateway Service:**
- CORS configured for production domains
- Rate limiting on POST /ingest endpoint
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- WebSocket authentication (future: JWT tokens)

**Simulator:**
- Demo only, not exposed in production
- API key for gateway communication (future)
- Event signing for authenticity (future)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics to Track

**Smart Contract:**
- Transaction success/failure rates
- Gas consumption per instruction
- Account rent status
- Program errors by type

**Gateway Service:**
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- WebSocket connection count
- Event processing throughput
- Memory usage and garbage collection

**Web Application:**
- Page load time
- Time to first paint
- WebSocket reconnection rate
- 3D scene FPS

### Logging Strategy

**Structured Logging:**
```typescript
logger.info({
  event: 'session_start',
  sessionId: 'abc123',
  stationId: 'stat-bravo',
  driver: '4Dx7...B3qR',
  energyKwh: 2.3,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

**Log Levels:**
- ERROR: Failed transactions, service crashes
- WARN: Retries, degraded performance
- INFO: Session starts/completions, purchases
- DEBUG: Individual event processing

## Design Patterns

### Oracle Pattern

The oracle pattern allows verified off-chain data to flow on-chain:

```
Real World Telemetry
    ↓
Oracle Service (signs data)
    ↓
Submit to Solana Program
    ↓
Program validates oracle signature
    ↓
Update on-chain state
```

This pattern is essential for DePIN projects that bridge physical and digital worlds.

### Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses events to decouple components:

```
Simulator → Events → Gateway → Events → Web App
                        ↓
                   Persistence (future)
                        ↓
                   Analytics (future)
```

Each component can be developed, tested, and scaled independently.

### Optimistic UI Updates

The web app updates optimistically before blockchain confirmation:

1. User initiates action (claim plot)
2. UI immediately shows "claiming..." state
3. Transaction submitted to blockchain
4. UI shows success on confirmation
5. Rollback on failure (rare)

This provides better UX than waiting for blockchain finality.

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Measurements

| Operation | Target Latency | Achieved |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| WebSocket event delivery | < 100ms | ~50ms |
| REST API response | < 200ms | ~80ms |
| 3D scene render | 60 FPS | 60 FPS |
| Solana transaction confirmation | < 1s | ~400ms |

### Throughput

| Metric | Current | Theoretical Max |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Gateway events/sec | ~50 | ~10,000 |
| WebSocket clients | ~10 | ~1,000 |
| Sessions/minute | ~4 | ~1,000 |
| Solana TPS | ~5 | 65,000 |

The system is far from any bottlenecks at demo scale.
